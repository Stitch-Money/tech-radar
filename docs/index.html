    <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>
    <p>
        The Stitch Tech Radar is a list of technologies currently being used or explored at Stitch. Each technology is placed into a category called a ring assignment based on what phase of evaluation it’s in. We use four rings with the following definitions:
    </p>

  <td></td>

        These are technologies that we have high confidence in to meet our requirements and are being used at scale.
